# npm to Bun Migration Design

## Overview

Replace npm with Bun as the package manager and runtime while keeping Vite as the bundler. This gives Bun's fast installs and execution while maintaining Vite's mature React dev experience.

## Scope

### Files to Modify

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Replace npm with Bun
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` - Replace npm with Bun
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Replace npm with Bun
- `.gitignore` - Add `bun.lock`

### Files to Delete

- `Dockerfile` - Unused, outdated
- `package-lock.json` - Replaced by `bun.lock`

### Files to Create

- `bun.lock` - Generated by `bun install`

## CI/Deploy Changes

All three GitHub workflows use the same pattern:

```yaml
# Before (npm)
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
- run: npm ci

# After (Bun)
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version: latest
- run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

- `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` is the official Bun GitHub Action with built-in caching
- `--frozen-lockfile` ensures CI fails if lockfile is out of sync
- `npm run X` becomes `bun run X` (or just `bun X`)
- `npx` becomes `bunx`

## Local Development

After migration:

```bash
bun install          # Instead of npm install
bun dev              # Instead of npm run dev
bun run build        # Instead of npm run build
bun lint             # Instead of npm run lint
bunx biome check src/  # Instead of npx biome check
```

No changes needed to `package.json` scripts - Bun runs them as-is.
